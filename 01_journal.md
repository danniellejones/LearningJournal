### Learning Activity

HTML & CSS Revision <br>
[Introduction to Web Design and Development (2014)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-web-design-and-development/welcome?u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 3h 38m <br>

#### Content Insights: <br>
The videos provided a brief overview of HTML, CSS and JS. It then talked about the discipline 
of web design and the areas of specialization. It went into more detail about web hosts, domain
names, content strategy, code editors, testing tools, prototyping, frameworks, standards and 
establishing your workflow. 

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights: <br>
I took notes while watching the videos in order to keep myself engaged, as well as document 
what I believed to be the most important information to my learning. After approximately an 
hour I found that I was looking at the contents to see how much longer the videos went for, 
it was at this point I had to acknowledge that it was time for a short break before continuing.
After watching approximately another hour of video, I found that I required another short break
in order to keep myself focused and engaged. The content that covered HTML, CSS and JS was a 
very good, but brief refresher of what I already knew about these topics; as I felt confident 
with this I sped up playback in these areas. When it came to CMS, web hosts and domain names 
I resumed normal playback and often found myself pausing, rewinding parts of the video to 
ensure that I fully understood before I moved on. My notes in these areas also became a little
more detailed. 
I decided that I should take on the workflow as outlined in the videos and adapt to my own 
needs - I recorded these steps in my notes. My objectives with website design should be to 
ensure that I have a strong foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS (or to confirm that is 
where I am at with my current knowledge); learning a base level of JavaScript is definitely 
my next step, then focusing in web hosting, CMS, domain names, publishing sites and testing.

### Learning Activity

HTML & CSS Revision <br>
[Introduction to Web Design and Development (2022)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-web-design-and-development-14628245/web-design-and-development-in-the-code-and-no-code-era?u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 1h 52m

#### Content Insights:
The roles within web design include: UI design, UX design and Back-End. There is a requirement
to use prototyping tools to test ideas before coding as part of the web design process. A 
fundamental understanding of CSS, HTML and JavaScript is required. It introduced the concepts
of target audience, planning using flowcharts or graphs and using prototyping software to 
develop quickly.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights: 
There were some video segments such as prototyping tools and graphic design tools that were 
less engaging as I had already dealt with Figma for other subjects and I have a background 
using graphic design tools. Although I was reluctant to watch videos on these topics, in the 
end it was good to refresh my memory and remain open to other suggested tools and software. 
The content of this introduction to web design video was much more simplistic than the other 
one that I watched. It was definitely preferable to watch the other video as it was more 
valuable to my learning.

### Learning Activity

Vagrant Setup <br>
[How to Install Vagrant on Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrQsxCPT2s) <br>
Estimate Time: 1h 52m

#### Content Insights:
Vagrant did not seem very straight forward to understanding which package to install; 
therefore, I looked up a video to assist with how to use this tool. The video demonstrates 
what programs are required such as virtual box and what commands to check that your 
installation was successful. There was a suggestion to use cmder tool as well, but I determined
this as unnecessary at this stage as I can use my windows cmd. In the later part of the video
it introduced the Vagrant cloud where you can access vagrant boxes (vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64). 
Virtual box is used passively by vagrant. 

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
The video was perhaps explored a little pre-mature as I am not a hundred percent certain that 
I need to know all of this information as I am not sure how this is going to help my process. 
The only reason I looked into this early is that it was mentioned in the lecture materials 
and I wanted to install any software in advance to not waste time on this at a later stage 
where it would impact my productivity. I have considered that Docker may be easier to use 
than vagrant - but until I use these tools I will not be able to make that determination. 

### Learning Activity

Vagrant Learning <br>
[Vagrant Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBreXjkizgo) <br>
Estimated Time: 46m

#### Content Insights:
Although this video was about installation and use on a Mac computer, I found it was better 
at explaining some components and process. It also helped to verify that the first 
video watched on the topic was giving the same or similar instructions - checking that it was 
correct.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Watching a second video was time-consuming over the same topic again, if there are faster 
ways of verifying the content or having content that is more trustworthy it would reduce the 
time required. I only observed the first portion of the video as it went more in-depth than 
I was concerned with at this stage.


### Learning Activity

Install Docker <br>
[WSL Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) <br>
Estimated Time: 10m

#### Content Insights:
Upon installing Docker I received a message that it required a newer WSL kernel version. 
I had no idea what that meant so I looked it up on the Windows learn site and eventually 
concluded that it was safe to proceed with the instructions given by the Docker software to 
update.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Although given instructions by the software I was installing, I was felt it was important to 
verify the suggestions were safe before acting on them - particularly as I did not understand 
what it meant by 'WSL kernel'. 

### Learning Activity

HTML <br>
[HTML Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/html-essential-training-4/the-role-of-html?autoAdvance=true&autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 2h 45m

#### Content Insights:
A compilation of videos on foundation-level HTML to re-learn/refresh my memory on the tags 
that are available, structure for my site and to ensure that understood how to construct my 
web pages. Notes.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
I looked for the most updated videos on HTML, I was able to find one from the last couple of 
years. I found very quickly watching these videos that I did not enjoy learning from this 
instructor, I felt the order of the videos was a little unnatural and had difficulty getting 
into the flow. Most of the content I was confident with from my experiences with HTML in 
CP1406 so I decided to speed up the playback of content until it addressed tags and 
structures that I was unfamiliar with. For the most part, I wrote shorthand notes as I know 
that I can look at sites like w3schools to go into more detail if I wanted to implement these
into my website. It was more about having a knowledge that these tags existed and what they 
accomplished, then included their formatting in my shorthand notes. I already noticed that 
some things taught in regards to responsive images was different to what was taught in CP1406
subject; it would be about making a decision to use the most appropriate format for the 
project or this would be perhaps where I establish my own personal standards for 
practice/code.
