Requirements:
Summarise the project. Highlight the tools and technologies used. Skills developed and role performed. Links to LinkedIn
profile of other team members. Keep it goal-focused (for employability) in first person and give relevant examples. What
hurdles were overcome and what are you now good at?

Report:
The project was to create a custom WordPress theme, then to create a website for Townsville Country Music Association
by utilising the custom WordPress theme.
The content management system WordPress was used to create the theme and site. GitHub was used for version control.
Jenkins and webhooks were used for the back-end between staging and live production site. Gulp files were used to
implement and manage Sass in local development environment.
Goal... example...
Overcome an overload of new information as my background and knowledge in Devops was limited, it took a lot for me to
get up to speed with where other teammates were quite knowledgeable. I did not want to slow down the team in their
fields, but I wanted to learn as much as I could to assist in discussions and problem-solving as required.

New skills obtained...

### Learning Activity

Presentations <br>
[Design a Compelling Presentation](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-graphic-design-presentations/welcome?u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 51m

#### Content Insights:

The LinkedIn video discussed techniques for maximising the potential of giving a presentation. It highlighted that a
presentation should feel more like a conversation than a performance. The presentation should contain
data (e.g. statistics) and a story (to connect emotionally). A report should include detailed information, a
presentation is only one essential point at one time.

Slides are a great tool, but only if they are done well and help advance your story. Slides should only contain images
that are helpful to explain something complex and where they help reinforce an important point. Slides should use a
minimal colour scheme. One slide for one point. Keep the theme of your slides consistent from start to the end and
simple as possible.

Style tips:

* Spacing of letters should be different for situations like one word slides and for specific fonts.
* Use dark backgrounds for dark rooms, white backgrounds for bright rooms and use colour to create
  contrast, beautiful and add emotional context.
* Use sans serif fonts, only where it is more decorative use serif fonts.
* Dramatize the information with graphics and connect to the story.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

No matter which field you end up working in, presentations are an essential skill. As technology developers it is
important that we are able to effectively communicate new technical ideas in a way that best communicates this to our
intended audience. It will be very important that we stick to the one-point to one-slide rule, as technology can become
complex quickly, and it will be hard to keep explanations simple. The use of storytelling will be vital to ensuring that
our audiences connect with the technical explanations that will need to be provided to a client.

### Learning Activity

Web Careers <br>
[Web Career Clinic](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/web-career-clinic/welcome?u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 1h

#### Content Insights:

The LinkedIn video explores career prospects in the web area. Important takeaways are highlighted below:

* Networking is best with diversity, get to know people that are different to you. Go to events that you are passionate
  about, not just random networking events. Help people with their projects to build trust.
* Curiosity and perseverance are valuable in starting out in a career.
* Get the basic skills first to help with problem-solving.
* Workplaces: agency, in-house and freelance.
* Informational interviews gain insights into a job where you ask someone that is already working in that field.
* Find work that you are passionate about rather than what are you already good at, what do you want to get good at?
* Create projects outside the classroom and practice your skills.
* Look at trends to know where to focus your career progress and skills.
* Set learning priorities and stick to your niche. Limit your time learning and set it during a productive time without
  distractions. Apply the learning.
* Repeat the creative brief, target audience and goals to the client before showing the prototype/mock up.
* Learn what code can do and what is possible. In design, ensure you can explain your decisions.
* Select a lane between design and code in order to be more effective in one lane.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

Developing a career plan to work towards a career goal will help to achieve my career goals. Any of the workplace
options are interesting to me for different reasons, so this has not helped to narrow down a goal workplace. I have
found myself passionate about working in mobile application development, but I want to learn more about building web
applications and websites. I acknowledge that I need to find more time to practice my skills and work on projects
outside my studies. I have started my own projects, but not completed anything; therefore, this will be an important
focus moving forward. It will be important to choose learning projects that will assist in applying the skills I want to
develop and work on them for a set time to make this learning more effective, productive and consistent throughout my
career. I do need to consider whether the code or design is the lane I should focus on in my career; this decision I
feel will be better determined after I have had more experience learning code.
