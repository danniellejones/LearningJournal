#### Content Insights:

The LinkedIn course discussed Agile and how it is different from standard project management. Agile is best suited when
there is no clear finished project or outcome. The process requires to be adaptive; therefore, there is a proposed
structure: stand-up meetings, planning, product demo and retrospective.

A stand-up meeting is for the developers where they physically stand for a short duration (15 minutes) and answer three
questions: What did I work on? What am I going to work on? What is in my way (roadblocks)? Each question should take
approximately 45 seconds to answer. The 15 minutes is a time-box that should be strictly adhered to - the activity ends
after the time ends. Stand-up meetings are about self-organising and should focus on achievable results.

After the stand-up meeting a planning meeting should be used to organise the backlog and pull the highest priority items
from the backlog to work on. These are the least structured meetings. In order to add items to the backlog use stories,
each developer adds a sticky note with a task that needs to be completed within one day, these are then converted into
tasks. It is important to minimise the tasks where possible to reduce context shifting.

A product demo is the opportunity to engage with stakeholders and gain feedback. The focus should shift here to the
stakeholders, rather than the developers tasks.

Retrospective occurs after the demo. This is about creating and finishing feedback loops amongst conversations and
passing constructive feedback to team members.

A scrum master has the responsibility to remove obstacles such as: Setup (Workspace), Mentoring (understanding Agile and
Backlog), Input (Input is asked for), Training (Assess Agile knowledge), and Hiring.

These meetings use time-boxing, which is a set time for the activity to occur. These blocks should remain constant
limited and measurable resource to ensure realistic achievable objectives.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

It is clear that shifting the mindset from manager and employee to this Agile way of thinking is difficult in the
workforce. It is important that there is someone knowledgeable, a scrum master, to maintain this structure to improve
overall productivity. It makes me wary that for our assignment that we do not have a 'scrum master' to maintain the
structure, but we must focus on self-organising for the stand-up meetings. I do think at the very least we find a way to
make ourselves accountable for the time-boxing limits and find a way to make that a habit for meetings.
