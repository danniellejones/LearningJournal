### Learning Activity

Mark Down <br>
[Learning GitHub - How to Write MarkDown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJojC3lSkwg) <br>
Estimated Time: 12m

#### Content Insights:
As the learning journal required the use of mark down I decided to watch a short tutorial
to use it effectively. The tutorial was brief and touched on the main points like links, text, headers, inline code
and images. It was interesting how similar this was to using HTML, but there were notable differences.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
In my search I decided to use a search term that included the words 'GitHub' in relation to markdown as I did not want
a comprehensive guide or hour long tutorial on mark down. I wanted to know just enough to use with GitHub. Narrowing 
down my search term also made the search itself quick and easy.

### Learning Activity

Live Templates <br>
[3min Quick Tip - How to use Live Templates in PhpStorm Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyHTNIkZ028&t=32s) <br>
Estimated Time: 4m

#### Content Insights:
In writing my learning journal I noticed how long it was taking to complete the same tasks, like creating headings in 
mark down. I decided to look at a short video that went through how to use PhpStorm's live templates to copy sections 
of code.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Finding small tools like live templates in the coding editor will help improve my productivity. I decided to learn it 
now so that I might be able to apply it to my coding practice later.

### Learning Activity

Plugins <br>
[Hubspot Website Plugins](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/website-plugins) <br>
[Free WordPress Plugins](https://winningwp.com/best-free-wordpress-plugins/) <br>
[49+ Best WordPress Plugins in 2022](https://wpforms.com/best-free-wordpress-plugins-for-your-website/) <br>
[WordPress.org Plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/free/) <br>
Estimated Time: 1h 10m

#### Content Insights:
Identified looking at the Assignment 1 documentation that the plan for the website contains plugins and I will need to
describe what they are used for. In preparation for this, I read articles online relating to website plugins in order 
to understand in general: what are plugins, and what are some options for plugins to use in my projects.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
I skim read articles to find the answers to the above questions - as most of these were blog posts I did not want to 
focus on irrelevant information or be swayed by advertisements. I wrote notes in regard to some of the plugins that 
are available (linked to their sites) that I thought I would need in the future, but there were so many options with 
different pricing levels therefore I thought it more beneficial to keep track of a couple good resources that outlines 
what these plugins achieve. This also gave me the opportunity to compare one recommended list to another to see if 
there were any suggestions that overlapped. 
It was evident through searches that WordPress had many options for plugins, but it was difficult to find plugins that 
did not mention WordPress even when doing a very broad online search "website plugins". The smarter move, I think, is 
to identify the gaps in the site and then find a plugin that assists in addressing this gap that work towards the 
website's overall goal. This way I can directly look at what CMS the plugins are compatible with. 

### Learning Activity

Startups <br>
[How to Get and Evaluate Startup Ideas | Startup School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th8JoIan4dg) <br>
Estimated Time: 33m

#### Content Insights:
Startup School speaker Jared Friedman discusses techniques for coming up with startup ideas and then how to evaluate
them. He discusses examples of startups and how their ideas started. The key takeaways is that startups solve 
real-world problems and in general they happen organically; however, if coming up with ideas the most successful need 
to have an intended market and boring topics (like accounting) are often contain winning ideas. Although, it also 
highlights that it does help to be interested in and have domain knowledge of an area that you wish to create a startup.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
It was interesting to hear stories of startups that mostly succeeded due to the founders having strong domain knowledge.
This should indicate to me that starting a startup should be in a domain I am interested in or have a strong
knowledge base in - in my case art, design or writing. This technique will help to evaluate my startup ideas and 
choose an idea that will be easier for me to implement for the first assignment. 

### Learning Activity

WordPress CMS <br>
[WordPress 5 Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-5-essential-training/wordpress-an-introduction?u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 2h 11m

#### Content Insights:

The WordPress 5 training discussed the basic toolbars and functionality of the WordPress application. In brief, it 
touched on the general navigation of WordPress and in detail explored the different block types available.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
I started this learning session later in the day after I had already been studying for many hours. I noticed that this 
impacted my engagement level significantly as I had to keep re-directing my focus back onto the materials rather than 
watching the time left to complete it. In the future, I will be mindful of not engaging in longer content at the end of my 
study session/day. 

### Learning Activity
