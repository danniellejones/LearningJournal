### Learning Activity

Mark Down <br>
[Learning GitHub - How to Write MarkDown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJojC3lSkwg) <br>
Estimated Time: 12m

#### Content Insights:
As the learning journal required the use of mark down I decided to watch a short tutorial
to use it effectively. The tutorial was brief and touched on the main points like links, text, headers, inline code
and images. It was interesting how similar this was to using HTML, but there were notable differences.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
In my search I decided to use a search term that included the words 'GitHub' in relation to markdown as I did not want
a comprehensive guide or hour long tutorial on mark down. I wanted to know just enough to use with GitHub. Narrowing 
down my search term also made the search itself quick and easy.

### Learning Activity

Live Templates <br>
[3min Quick Tip - How to use Live Templates in PhpStorm Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyHTNIkZ028&t=32s) <br>
Estimated Time: 4m

#### Content Insights:
In writing my learning journal I noticed how long it was taking to complete the same tasks, like creating headings in 
mark down. I decided to look at a short video that went through how to use PhpStorm's live templates to copy sections 
of code.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Finding small tools like live templates in the coding editor will help improve my productivity. I decided to learn it 
now so that I might be able to apply it to my coding practice later.

### Learning Activity

Plugins <br>
[Hubspot Website Plugins](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/website-plugins) <br>
[Free WordPress Plugins](https://winningwp.com/best-free-wordpress-plugins/) <br>
[49+ Best WordPress Plugins in 2022](https://wpforms.com/best-free-wordpress-plugins-for-your-website/) <br>
[WordPress.org Plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/free/) <br>
Estimated Time: 1h 10m

#### Content Insights:
Identified looking at the Assignment 1 documentation that the plan for the website contains plugins and I will need to
describe what they are used for. In preparation for this, I read articles online relating to website plugins in order 
to understand in general: what are plugins, and what are some options for plugins to use in my projects.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
I skim read articles to find the answers to the above questions - as most of these were blog posts I did not want to 
focus on irrelevant information or be swayed by advertisements. I wrote notes in regard to some of the plugins that 
are available (linked to their sites) that I thought I would need in the future, but there were so many options with 
different pricing levels therefore I thought it more beneficial to keep track of a couple good resources that outlines 
what these plugins achieve. This also gave me the opportunity to compare one recommended list to another to see if 
there were any suggestions that overlapped. 
It was evident through searches that WordPress had many options for plugins, but it was difficult to find plugins that 
did not mention WordPress even when doing a very broad online search "website plugins". The smarter move, I think, is 
to identify the gaps in the site and then find a plugin that assists in addressing this gap that work towards the 
website's overall goal. This way I can directly look at what CMS the plugins are compatible with. 

### Learning Activity

Startups <br>
[How to Get and Evaluate Startup Ideas | Startup School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th8JoIan4dg) <br>
Estimated Time: 33m

#### Content Insights:
Startup School speaker Jared Friedman discusses techniques for coming up with startup ideas and then how to evaluate
them. He discusses examples of startups and how their ideas started. The key takeaways is that startups solve 
real-world problems and in general they happen organically; however, if coming up with ideas the most successful need 
to have an intended market and boring topics (like accounting) are often contain winning ideas. Although, it also 
highlights that it does help to be interested in and have domain knowledge of an area that you wish to create a startup.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
It was interesting to hear stories of startups that mostly succeeded due to the founders having strong domain knowledge.
This should indicate to me that starting a startup should be in a domain I am interested in or have a strong
knowledge base in - in my case art, design or writing. This technique will help to evaluate my startup ideas and 
choose an idea that will be easier for me to implement for the first assignment. 

### Learning Activity

WordPress CMS <br>
[WordPress 5 Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-5-essential-training/wordpress-an-introduction?u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 2h 11m

#### Content Insights:

The WordPress 5 training discussed the basic toolbars and functionality of the WordPress application. In brief, it 
touched on the general navigation of WordPress and in detail explored the different block types available.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
I started this learning session later in the day after I had already been studying for many hours. I noticed that this 
impacted my engagement level significantly as I had to keep re-directing my focus back onto the materials rather than 
watching the time left to complete it. In the future, I will be mindful of not engaging in longer content at the end of my 
study session/day. 

### Learning Activity

Bootstrap 5 <br>
[Bootstrap 5 Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/bootstrap-5-essential-training/the-most-popular-framework?autoplay=true&u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 4h 20m; Actual Time: 10m

#### Content Insights:
When starting the first workshop task, I wanted to use bootstrap (I had already downloaded a zip folder). I had no idea 
how to really make it work, so I tried some playing around in PHPStorm. Still unsuccessful, I referred to LinkedIn 
learning to provide an overview of how to use Bootstrap. I wanted to watch a video based on the same version that I had
downloaded to prevent confusion. Straight away I had no idea what the video was talking about. It used a lot of acronyms
I did not understand and felt it was far beyond a beginners level to the content. 

After completing Bootstrap 2021 learning activity... <br>
Upon returning to this tutorial, it made a lot more sense after I completed the easier tutorial and I spent some time
exploring the [getbootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/) and the [popper website](https://popper.js.org/). This 
revealed icons and other templates that are available for download/use. I found it useful throughout the video to use 
the project 'Bare', started in the Bootstrap 2021 learning activity, to test and experiment with the topics addressed in this 
video.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
I realised that spending the next 4 hours on a tutorial that was far too advanced would not be productive. In response,
I sought a different learning video to see if a different teacher would help take a different approach to the content.
Before leaving the current video, I did a sneak-peak of the chapters this video covered and determined that it might be 
beneficial to return to this content when I obtained a better base-level understanding. 



### Learning Activity

Bootstrap 2021 <br>
[Create a quick, clean, and cheap website with Bootstrap templates](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/create-a-quick-clean-and-cheap-website-with-bootstrap-templates/what-you-need?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 1h 50m

#### Content Insights:
This video suggested to use [Start Bootstrap site](https://startbootstrap.com/) to learn how to use Boostrap. It started
with simple and clear explanations on the grid layout. It was after this point I was able to determine that this video 
was more appropriate to my current knowledge level. It was also interesting to consider that obtaining templates from 
online can raise copyright concerns - not all templates are free and often need to be purchased. The last sections of
the pathway went through basic HTML elements and was not useful to increasing my understanding of Bootstrap. 

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Prevent wasting time by choosing learning content that starts at your current learning level/ability. It is important
that within the first 5-10 minutes to make a judgement on whether this is the right starting point. The listed 
chapters also allow one to look ahead to see if there is any further relevant content to your learning. This will help 
improve my engagement with the LinkedIn learning resources.
