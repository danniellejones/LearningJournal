#### Content Insights:

Use proto-persona's in order to develop design suited to your target audience. All elements on a page should help to
tell the story and explain your content. Use consistent design in navigation and naming, it is about the time it takes
the user to learn how to use your website. Use standard design to help with this as well (similar components or
placement to other sites). Information should be at a glance to navigate themselves and identify the appropriate
content. Navigation can be set up using verbs (task based) or nouns (category based); this is the informational
architecture foundations, then it moves into content. Drop-down menus for older users requires a delay before closing,
or they can become frustrating. Visual cues helps people to navigate through their websites and allows them to believe
they will find what they are looking for in the site. The length of the search box will change what people are likely to
enter as a search term. Links need to be considered carefully and be careful how much you deviate from the blue
underline convention. Every page should let you know about what the site is about, this is because from a search engine
it is unlikely they will start from your home page. Write a single sentence about what your site is about and use the
tagline in the header below your site name, but above the navigation - or place this in the browser tab title. Content
that overflows a page should be handled by: scrolling, sequential or splitting. It is important to make an informed
decision about if your content will be more or less confusing by implementing one of these methods. Never use more than
three levels of headings and provide a summary for each page. Provide the conclusion in the beginning, then provide more
detail, at the bottom provide background information. The home page should pass the five-second test to see if it
communicates a clear overall message. Build trust with your clients before asking for too much information from them in
a web form. Keep it short where possible and explain why you need that information.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

It was interesting to consider how important delays in closing navigation will be beneficial to older users. This will
definitely be considered in the group project. It will also be important that our group considers creating and using
proto-personas to help our design. The membership form on the website should be carefully considered, as the current
form is quite lengthy and may not be appropriate for web.
