#### Content Insights:

The LinkedIn video provides information about how to secure WordPress websites. General important points are recorded
below:

* Backup website plugin - UpdraftPlus plugin
* For restore use PhpMyAdmin for the database; after restoring a site ensure to test fully. FTP can be used for the
  files.
* Use the most up-to-date WordPress core files, plugins (updates notifier plugin will help) and themes.
* Use strong passwords using a password manager. Use the Users section to help handle password management and roles.
  Ensure that users do not use generic names e.g. admin.
* Check the information provided and evaluate for trustworthiness before selecting a plugin.
* Remove unused files/folders, plugins, themes and disable past users.
* Protect the configuration file.
* Set the display name different from the username used in WordPress. A plugin can be used to block user enumerations.
* Set up a firewall. Protect against bots and spam.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

So far in the group project it is clear that security has been placed on a back burner as the team
has been focused on learning to use WordPress and developing a workflow rather than focusing on the effective use of the
CMS. It is clear that we need to review our security practices and update where we are able. Next time these
considerations will be implemented earlier in the process of development. Most of the content will be more important for
future projects and some security needs may be project specific.
