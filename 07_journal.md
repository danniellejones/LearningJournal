#### Content Insights:

The video broke down the basics of using and setting up PHP. There is a particularly interesting section that delves
into forms at the end, but I did not follow along with the practical tasks here, I only watched this section. It is
likely a good reference if this is required later in the group project. It was interesting the small snippets of
information that helped to understand a little more of the security side of using PHP and creating dynamic content.

It was particularly helpful to go through the setup again as I had used PHP before, but when I went to go and use it I
could not remember how to get to run in PHPStorm again. I had forgotten! This video was a great refresher to know how to
get up and running again. As I had only touched on very few things in PHP it was good to pick up on the differences in
syntax as I have been working in all kinds of programming languages at present.

### Learning Activity

MySQL in relation to PHP <br>

#### Content Insights:

For each directory there should be an index.php file to prevent exposing files (security issue). If having a members
section, create a directory for those pages under a folder called members in the public directory. Initialise php file
can be useful for containing constants for the directory paths in one place, it still means that the directory path for
initialise will be a specified path. Create a function to find the absolute URL, this is a handy tool. 

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

I found understanding some of this video a little overwhelming. It was not clear about what and why we were doing these
tasks at times. I attempted just to pick up on small snippets of relevant information as re-watching and slowing down
the video did not help my understanding. I think this is because when the 'why' was explained, it was short and
there wasn't a lot of visual information to assist understanding before the demonstration.
