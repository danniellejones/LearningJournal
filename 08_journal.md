### Learning Activity

Learning Experiment <br>

Experiment: <br>
Teamwork has been difficult to coordinate remotely as it is hard to determine if everyone is always present and
attentive during meetings. This has caused meetings to become unnecessarily long (approx. 3 hours) and not an effective
use of our project time. My experiment will be the use of a timer bot in Discord to help manage the meeting time length.
A timer will be set for 1.5 hours for the full meeting duration, another timer for 15 minutes maximum for the stand-up
and 15 minutes for the planning session.
<br>

Metric: <br>
The success of the experiment will be measured by the overall duration of the meeting. If I can get a 50% improvement
(1.5 hours) on our meeting time, then it will be marked a success.
