### Learning Activity

Learning Experiment <br>

Experiment: <br>
Teamwork has been difficult to coordinate remotely as it is hard to determine if everyone is always present and
attentive during meetings. This has caused meetings to become unnecessarily long (approx. 3 hours) and not an effective
use of our project time. My experiment will be the use of a timer bot in Discord to help manage the meeting time length.
A timer will be set for 1.5 hours for the full meeting duration, another timer for 15 minutes maximum for the stand-up
and 15 minutes for the planning session.
<br>

Metric: <br>
The success of the experiment will be measured by the overall duration of the meeting. If I can get a 50% improvement
(1.5 hours) on our meeting time, then it will be marked a success.
<br>
Estimated Time: 1h 30m

#### Experiment Insights:

The timer was introduced to the team and set during the meeting time. I was less concerned with the stand-up meeting
time, as these had been of an appropriate length. The team acknowledged the use of the timer and this appeared to make
them announce to the rest of the team when the planning timer had ended, which helped make the team time aware and
accountable to the allotted time. The meeting ended up running for approximately 45 minutes. There was some stagnating
at the end of whether it was ready to be concluded.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

Making the team more time aware appeared to make a difference to the meeting length. It would be beneficial to replicate
this experiment in future team meetings to see if the effects are long-term. Although the meeting length did not reach
the 1.5-hour timer, I speculate that if discussion was fading, when the timer went off it would have been a good signal
that the meeting needed to end. Overall, the experiment was a success in accordance with the metric detailed above.

Estimated Time: 30min

#### Content Insights:

WP-Rig is a good starter theme to use if you are concerned about optimising performance. It has a wiki with
suggested plugins and other aspects to use during development.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

I had already done research into starter themes before watching this video. This video helped to confirm that I was
happy with the decision that our group made as it required further dependencies than our current setup. However, it
would be interesting to try a different starter theme in more depth in a new future project when I was feeling more
confident to continue experimenting with more complex workflows and setups.

### Learning Activity

DRY Development <br>
[WordPress Developer Tips: DRY Development](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-developer-tips-dry-development/welcome?u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 35m

#### Content Insights:

Package up commonly used functions into their own files. Modularise code wherever possible to improve code maintenance.
Header, Footer, Sidebar are all handled with a call to a function that gets the header etc. Use a loop to go through all
posts to display. These are all template parts used in the index.php file to reduce the amount of code. Conditional tags
test for true or false; all available conditional tags are listed on WordPress's website.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

It was great to smooth over the sort of patchy understanding I had on how themes and templates come together. I think
that this knowledge would have been beneficial much earlier in my learning process when trying to change an existing
WordPress theme for the first assignment. There was a big learning curve that would have been clarified quickly by this
video.
