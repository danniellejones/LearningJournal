Web Design Process <br>
[Mapping the Modern Web Design Process](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/mapping-the-modern-web-design-process/create-great-informational-user-experiences?autoplay=true&u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 2h 15m

#### Content Insights:
The LinkedIn course on the modern web design process highlighted topics such as: roles/responsibilities, creating guides,
and the web design process overall. It was important to note the separation of roles where it recommends that UX design, 
System Architect, Quality Assurance and Beta Testing roles are separated at minimum from the person involved in the 
other roles e.g. Front-End, Back-End Developers. It was also interesting to hear about the guides: style, content, code
and process. These aspects will help with understanding future team dynamics in web design and basic methods to 
improve collaboration. The aspects on the web design process were interesting where it was described as a 
'dynamic process', which means the foundations of the process will stay the same, but adaptability is key.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
This course expanded my mind to the more in-depth realm of web design and how building sites can become more complex. At 
this point my view was rather narrow, that websites only really need a single person or a small team. It has made web 
design more daunting as a career option, particularly due to how much I have struggled with developing live web 
environments. The process is very theoretical still,  which is good as a foundation, but I will not be able to cement my 
understanding until I have successfully followed the process myself.
