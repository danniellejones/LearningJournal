### Learning Activity

Web Design Process <br>
[Mapping the Modern Web Design Process](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/mapping-the-modern-web-design-process/create-great-informational-user-experiences?autoplay=true&u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 2h 15m

#### Content Insights:

The LinkedIn course on the modern web design process highlighted topics such as: roles/responsibilities, creating
guides, and the web design process overall. It was important to note the separation of roles where it recommends that UX
design, System Architect, Quality Assurance and Beta Testing roles are separated at minimum from the person involved in
the other roles e.g. Front-End, Back-End Developers. It was also interesting to hear about the guides: style, content,
code and process. These aspects will help with understanding future team dynamics in web design and basic methods to
improve collaboration. The aspects on the web design process were interesting where it was described as a
'dynamic process', which means the foundations of the process will stay the same, but adaptability is key.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

This course expanded my mind to the more in-depth realm of web design and how building sites can become more complex. At
this point my view was rather narrow, that websites only really need a single person or a small team. It has made web
design more daunting as a career option, particularly due to how much I have struggled with developing live web
environments. The process is very theoretical still, which is good as a foundation, but I will not be able to cement my
understanding until I have successfully followed the process myself.

### Learning Activity

Version Control <br>
[Versional Control for Everyone](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/version-control-for-everyone-2/version-control-it-s-not-just-for-programmers?autoplay=true&u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 1h 43m

#### Content Insights:

The LinkedIn course gave an overview of version control and how to use it for different applications. The most
significant part was Section 5 on sharing a project, which may be required for future reference when looking at
assignment 2. Basic process is as follows:
Fork > Branch > Commit Changes > Push > Pull Request > Merge Pull Request > Fetch > Pull

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

This course really only felt a little valuable towards the end, but it did suggest there was a course called GitHub for
Web Designers for further (hopefully more context specific) learning.

### Learning Activity

Moving from Local Environment to Live Environment <br>
[Migrating WordPress with Migrating DB and DB Pro](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/migrating-wordpress-with-wp-migrate-db-and-db-pro/who-this-course-is-for-and-how-it-works?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=2223545) <br>
[WordPress Migration 2020](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-migration/preparing-for-migration?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 2h 7m

#### Content Insights:

The migration courses from LinkedIn talked about using WP Migrate DB in order to create the .sql.gz file that would then
be imported into the live site database using PhpMyAdmin. It then used FTP to transfer across the files from the
wp-content folder for the plugins and themes. In order to follow this process the live site needed to have the database
setup with a fresh installation of WordPress to use the plugin.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

These videos felt like the step after the one I was up to in terms of setting up a live site as I hadn't gotten the
database set up correctly yet. It was good to watch as it gave me some new insight into perhaps some of the things I was
doing wrong and why I was struggling with the database at this point. It gave me a new direction of things to try.

### Learning Activity

Databases and Linking to Live Site <br>
[Azure Data Studio Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/azure-data-studio-essential-training-15050110/what-is-azure-data-studio?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=2223545) <br>
[Azure Essential Training for Developers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/azure-essential-training-for-developers/azure-for-developers?autoplay=true&u=2223545) <br>

Estimated Time: 2h 54m, Actual Time: 30m

#### Content Insights:

I looked at Azure training videos on LinkedIn in hopes that it might help me figure out how to make my Azure SQL
database usable for my website. All the current information I kept finding online for how to implement a website
involved a Azure SQL database, but the instructions were out-dated and the buttons they used to perform the setups were
no longer available. Unfortunately this content only provided overview information, not the specific detail that I was
looking for.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

There were so many out-dated learning materials for Microsoft Azure that it made me contemplate changing web hosts.
I generally am a click-around-and-figure-it-out kind of person, but it has not been clear where to do anything.
If I am unable to use Docker containers to set up my site on Microsoft Azure, I might be forced to change as I cannot 
find relevant material to understand how to deploy my sites. 

### Learning Activity

Docker, Docker Desktop and Docker-Compose <br>
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) <br>
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) <br>
[How to deploy Joomla with Docker](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-deploy-joomla-docker/) <br>
[Docker and ACI](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/) <br>
Estimated Time: 10h

#### Content Insights:

The first part of the learning journey was to understand Docker containers and Docker images. The second part of the
journey was creating them, running them and connecting them to a network. The third part was looking writing a docker
compose file. The last part was learning how to use this on Microsoft Azure.
