### Learning Activity

Group Interviews <br>
Estimated Time: Interview 1m, Reflection 1h

#### Conditions:

A one-minute time limit for questioning warrants a mixture of both open and closed questions.
It is important that as an 'employer' in this context that it is clear what qualities are being sought.

#### Ideal Candidate:

An ideal candidate for the prescribed questions is a student that aims for a grade in the top tier (HD, D), has little
or no issues with using digital tools, is able to reflect on an experience in group-work (and bonus if they were
part of the solution to resolve the issue), are available at least one time that the majority of other team members are
available, and that is able to identify definitively a strength in either category (but bonus if they identify one in
each). Qualities: Ambitious/Perseverance, Self-Reflective, Available/Flexible, Self-Aware, Tech Savvy

#### Questions:

1. What are grade do realistically aim to achieve in this subject?
2. How comfortable are you with online meetings and using digital whiteboard tools for collaboration?
3. Tell me about a problem you experienced with a team in the past and how you overcame it?
4. What are the three best times in your availability for team meetings?
5. What would you consider is your greatest strength in either web development or in teamwork management?

### Learning Activity

WordPress: Workflows <br>
[WordPress: Workflows (2015)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-workflows-2015/welcome?autoplay=true&u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 1h 6m

#### Content Insights:

The WordPress: Workflows LinkedIn video was divided into three sections from a novice, then moving into more
advanced workflows. I decided it was important to watch all the videos to see how each led into the next. It was very
useful in providing more detail to what constitutes as a local environment verses a live environment (staging and
production).
It suggested that as part of your workflow it was smart to set up on a live environment early so that you can properly
test your site. It also suggested for teams working on themes (like the second assignment) that when using version
control there should be a Master (stable) version, a development branch, and a feature/experiment branch. This ensures
you always having a working and stable version during development. Themes were discussed as either a parent or a child
theme, these can be made to work in unison where the parent can be used with modifications from the child theme. The
parent theme can act as a backup and receive updates in case the child theme ever becomes non-usable.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

It was interesting to learn that creating WordPress themes is a potential career pathway, I will definitely keep this in
mind as a career prospect in the near future. I will use the second assignment as a test to see if this is a career
opportunity I am particularly interested in and hopefully learn as much as I can to potentially pursue this avenue.
In terms of learning from this pathway, I would say that development environments are slowly becoming less confusing,
but I still need to understand how vagrant and the actual setup of the CMS fits into this equation.

### Learning Activity

Joomla CMS <br>
[Joomla! 4 Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/joomla-4-essential-training/the-flexible-platform-for-website-creators?autoplay=true&u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 5h 30m

#### Content Insights:

The LinkedIn pathway for Joomla essentials started with installation instructions suggesting to select a host from the
suggestions on their website. These instructions were not helpful; therefore, I sought further information from ChatGPT.
The remaining video delved into an overview of the different elements of Joomla's interface. It did emphasise to put the
content in place first before worrying about the theme or appearance of the site - this was different from what was
suggested in the workflows video that was more test as you go. It was interesting that it showed how to use the CAPTCHA
plugin which could be very useful for my contact form. A contact list in Joomla could also be useful for the teams page
display on the site. It also showed how using modules in the same position can be useful for the features section of my
site.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

In starting this pathway I kept wanting to start doing things as the video was doing them. I found that this was not
conducive to my learning as I was no longer listening to the next parts of the video and had to re-watch sections.
Equally, pausing the video and trying it also made me too distracted. I found
that taking notes whilst watching the video was much more productive. I want to cover the topics in this subject in as
much detail as possible as this is a career prospect I am very interested in; however, I need to consider that some
aspects, such as modifying the admin template, are less relevant to me at this stage of my learning. Changing things
like this at this point can make watching tutorials very hard to follow as it will be different to the default. I will
aim at only retaining a surface level understanding of these type of topics at this stage.

### Learning Activity

Docker Basics <br>
[Get up and running quick with Docker](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-docker-17236240/help-i-can-t-seem-to-create-more-containers?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=2223545) <br>
Estimated Time: 1h 57m

#### Content Insights:

When starting this LinkedIn course I believed I was at a stage that made sense to learn and then implement Docker into
my workflow. There was strong emphasis on using the command line to create containers and images, despite their being a
GUI available for Windows. The most I was able to understand what Docker does is that it creates a container to contain
the requirements for running the web app correctly. Also, it is easier to use than vagrant which is a virtual
environment.

#### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

At the end of watching these videos I found myself able to understand the commands, but I did not understand how Docker
is meant to really work with my site. I think that I need to see how this all works with the context that I am working
in before I really understand Docker. I attempted to look at a few other videos online to see if there was a good
example use case, but I have not yet been successful.
